This robot can simultaneously hold up to three books on three different bookshelves. It employs Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the best path localization to the destination and has an RFID reader for detecting books using RFID tags. In order to guarantee smooth velocity profiles and avoid jerky movements during navigation, a Gaussian function is utilized. The robot uses gyroscope and magnetometer data to assess orientation and applies a moving average filter on accelerometer data to decrease noise. A complimentary filter is used to combine the data from the rotary encoders and moving average filter in order to estimate distance.  Through an onboard microcontroller, the Data Processing Unit (DPU) gathers sensory and navigation data from encoders, accelerometers, and range sensors. The data is then sent to the DPU for processing in order to minimize power usage.
